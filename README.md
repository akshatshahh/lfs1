# movie-recommender-microsoft
Hello Team 

Direct working project link deployed on Heroku - https://movie-recommender-microsoft.herokuapp.com

You can find all the files on the above github repositories .

I have managed to make a Content based Recommendation System.

Please Download whole repository as a folder ,

Go to app.py on any of the terminals such as Visual Studio Code and type in terminal "streamlit run app.py". 
Necessary files to make sure that app.py runs are "movies.pkl" and "similarity.pkl" 


Note - "similarity_pkl.zip" should be extracted without fail to get results .

You can check my pre-processing of 5000 movies and credits in python_project.ipynb and run all of them to know how did I do it ,
where the last step involves deployment into movies.pkl and similarity.pkl .

Thank you for Reading,

Akshat Shah
